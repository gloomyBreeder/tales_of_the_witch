# Tales of the Witch

What fairy tale will the Witch tell us today? Hmm, let me think about it... Oh, I have one in mind! This tale will be quite classic because it has a place for travel, battles, friendship and even for a talking magical cat! Imagine that you are an elf who is good with a sword as well as combat elemental magic, but at the same time leads a quiet modest life in the village? Imagined? Well, what if one day you wake up in the middle of the ocean and see a mysterious portal? What happened here and where does this portal lead? You have to find out!

This is a prototype of an action adventure game. Currently I have implemented a melee and ranged combat system, telekinesis mechanics, a quest system, a dialogue system, a teleportation system, a cutscene system, an enemy spawn system and their behavioral machine, an NPC (bird) spawn system, a loot spawn and scoring system, destructible objects.

All sounds, music, animations, 3D objects, UI images are not mine and were taken from mixamo, sketchfab, freesound and different stock-free sites.
